# Rookplay

This project was created during our first few months of studying web development at YRGO. The objective was to design and implement a landing page for a fictitious store using Figma, JavaScript, and CSS. Our goal was to demonstrate our growing proficiency in front-end development. The end results showcase a chess site that sells chessboards, tickets and pieces from the world chess championship. Since the assignment was only to create a landing page it is only a one page site.

Deployed site: https://rookplay.vercel.app

Thanks for viewing the project.
